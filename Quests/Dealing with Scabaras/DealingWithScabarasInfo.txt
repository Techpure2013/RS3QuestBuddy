Climb over the low wall and talk to the people by the tents. Read their questions carefully and always round down. (Chat 1•3)`
Talk to them again for an empty crate.`
At this point, if you do have 60 Crafting, skip to the next step. If you do not have 60 Crafting, fetch the bronze items that are written in your quest guide, use them on the crate and return to the archaeologists. This will take 3 hours so if 60 Crafting is obtainable within that time frame it is highly recommended to do that instead. (Chat 1•1)

The next section is a race against time. Read it fully before continuing. You need to pass all challenges succesfully in one go, otherwise you need to tell the golem to reset the levers so you can try again.`
Note: it is possible to empty the storage box of logs so you might need to bring your own in case you fail at first attempt. And if you have a lower firemaking level, you might not be able to stoke the furnace. For example: the storage box has a chance to give you magic logs and if your FM level is below 75 then you won't be able to continue, unless you bring your own logs.`
