Talk to him again several (3+) times to receive more discs. Use the drop trick. (Chat 1). The more discs, the more streamlined the process in the next step becomes as you require little to no converting.`
Unlock machine to view the desired number.`
If necessary, use the exchanger to get a disc equal to your number (refer to conversion chart below). If you have trouble converting, refer to the full guide here.`
Unlock the machine with the correct value disc. Click the small green square to submit the disc.`
Unlock the machine again to get 3 different numbers (the second unlock will require many more discs). Use the exchanger as necessary. The 2nd number requires using 2 discs and the 3rd requires 3.`
If you intend to do The Path of Glouphrie afterwards, keep the discs in your inventory as they are needed here as well.`
