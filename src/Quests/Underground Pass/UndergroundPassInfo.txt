Items needed: a bow (shieldbows will not work), some arrows, 2 - 4 ropes, a plank.`
Items recommended: Combat gear and a few food to fight 8 enemies.`
From this point onward, you will be needing about 14 free inventory slots. Close to the end, you will need to unequip all items into your inventory to continue the last few steps.`
This means that you might have to sacrifice some items such as your ropes and plank. All item dropped will be gone since you will be teleported out.(Use This map at the step to navigate the underground pass)`
Talk to Koftik in the western most part of West Ardougne. (Chat 1)`
Enter the cave and use side passages with rockslides to bypass centre swampy path.`
Talk to Koftik for a cloth. Use it on an arrow and then light the arrow.`
Make sure you are standing around the bend to the north. Equip your bow and the lit arrow. Shoot the guide rope attached to the bridge.`
The plank for passing through some traps further in the cave is located just after the bridge to the north. Only one is needed.`
Continue through the cave (south east) until you reach a gap north of the rope swing. Use a rope on the tiny Old spike at the edge of the gap on your side.`
Check under your character if it is standing at the edge of the ledge for the interact option on the old spike.`
If you fail the obstacle, you can climb out of the pit via rocks on the north western wall past some rockslides.`
Continue through the cave over the two rockslides until you reach a large grid (5x5) next to Koftik.`
Find your path across the grid. Keep a record of the path over the grid for Regicide quest. You will fall through some of the tiles.`
Pull the lever to the south at the end to continue.`
Have minimum of 4 free inventory slots.`
Run past the zombie camp, there will be odd markings along the walls of the corridor. These are traps, search these walls to disarm them. (You can skip disarming by standing right next to the trapped tile and then running to the other side of the tile. This can also be done on the next step)`
You will reach a Chaos altar, take the north path using planks on the flat rocks. Take the orb of light. Return back to the altar.`
Take the north-west path towards the Ogre. Take the orb. Return back to the altar.`
Take the middle west path, traversing the flat rocks as before using the plank. Take the orb.`
By the well, find and read the old journal before the next step (or you will not find a flat rock to search under the orb to disarm the trap)`
Take the final path and don't pick up the orb right away. Search the rock underneath the orb to disarm the trap first and then take the orb. If successful your character will automatically pick up the orb. If not, continue trying to search the rock.`
Return to the zombie camp (don't forget about disarming the traps).`
Use the 4 orbs on the furnace.`
Return to the altar (again, don't forget about the traps), and climb down the well. (You can search the two stacked crates for 2 salmon and 2 meat pies.)`

Reach the dwarf camp in the cavern below by following one of two methods.`
Head south along the wall to the south-east corner then head west along the south wall to find the stairs there. Take the stairs down.`
There are also stairs in the north-west corner that may be easier to find but will require players to make their way through the herd of hostile soulless in the centre of the cavern below on the way to the dwarf camp.`
Run to the dwarf camp in the cavern's south-western corner and talk to Niloof the dwarf.`
Go back up the stairs. Head to the central part of the map by crossing the wooden bridges to pick up the Witch's cat, the cat should be wandering out on the bridges and platforms north-west of her house (marked by a yellow dot on the mini map). The Witch's house is the most south-eastern platform.`
Use the cat on the Witch's door.`
Open the door to the Witch's house.`
Search the chest in her house for a few items and the History of Iban book.`
Click the chest once to trigger a dialogue. Prematurely ending the dialogue will require you to wait for the chest to close, or logout.`

Open and search the chest north of the middle demon. Pour Iban's shadow on the Doll of Iban.`
Return downstairs and talk to Klank the dwarf, taking his gauntlets.`
