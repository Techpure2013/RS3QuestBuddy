Take lots of high-healing food, including a full BoB if possible. Wear the Dragonkin protective charm at all times, and pray against melee.`
Defeat Abomination in the Brimhaven Dungeon in the tunnel found in the south-west corner where steel dragons are.`
Focus on mining the 4 pillars in the room while avoiding his attacks. Surge, double surge, and bladed dive can be useful in avoiding damage from the Abomination's rotating beam of fire.`
His charge attacks are often not aimed at the player, meaning you don't always need to move.`
When a pillar cannot be mined any more, lure a fireball attack into the pillar. Click the water pool if you get hit to cool off.`
Repeat until all 4 pillars are broken.
A good strategy is to stand near the pillar and take the fireball damage, this guarantees the destruction of the pillar as long as it is no longer minable.`
Lure Tarshak into the falling rocks, don't stand too close yourself.`
You may also attack with a regular weapon at the same time.`
Once Tarshak reaches 458 life points, he will no longer take damage from falling rocks, and you must deal the final blow yourself.`
