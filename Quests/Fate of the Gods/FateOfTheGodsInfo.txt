Speak to Azzanadra. (Chat ✓•2•~•4•~•~)`
The following part can be skipped if you already activated the World Gate after Mahjarrat Memories.`
Click the controls right near the gate until you reach Trident glyph`
Rotate left until you reach a downward road fork glyph`
Rotate right until you reach a multi-path fork from the center`
Step away from the controls, and speak to Sliske again.`
Put on a face mask or equivalent protection to avoid taking 50 damage every 15 seconds while in Freneskae.`
Enter the World Gate to enter Freneskae.`
Run through Freneskae using the map below to reach the Sanctum. Move fast and avoid the hazards. There are healing points along the way if needed.`
Optional: collect the memoriam crystals along the way. They are numbered on the map below, start with collecting number 9 and then the rest as you move along (they don't need to be collected in order).`
Optional: Deposit collected Memoriam crystals in the middle to see memories.`
Go to North side of the room to the door puzzle.`
Match the symbols up together to light up the lines in between them three times to open the door, then enter.`
Kill the four nihils then enter the next area (to the north). All nihils use a special attack after hissing. Each nihil always runs in the same direction. Therefore, a pair of nihil (ice and shadow or smoke and blood) can be killed first, leaving areas between the tracks unused and safe. Don't stand in the middle, as you might be dashed by multiple nihils at once.`
The smoke nihil attacks with Magic. Its special attack will decrease Attack, Strength, Magic, Ranged, and Defence by 15. Its charge will decrease these stats by 5.`
The shadow nihil attacks with Ranged, and its special attack creates Nex-like shadow bomb at the position of player that deals rapid damage. Players should move away as soon as the floor below them is darkened by a circular spot. Shadow nihil darkens the whole screen whenever it approaches the player, both when charging or fighting the player, but this causes no gameplay difference.`
The blood nihil attacks with melee. Its special attack causes all incoming damage to heal it, indicated when the creature lowers its head and begin to glow. It also will passively heal other nihil if it is damaged. Its charge inflicts a bleed similar to Slaughter that begins at 100 damage.`
The ice nihil attacks with Magic, and its special attack applies a six second stun and drains player's Prayer points by 50% of its maximum. Its charge drains the player's Prayer points by 25% of its maximum.`
Items needed: good equipment and a lot of food`
Items recommended: a beast of burden and a quick teleport`
If you accept Zaros' help against Mah, he will provide you with full prayer for use with Ancient Curses along the fight and less damage from Mah.`
Attempt to descend the ledge (to the north) then speak to Zaros. (Chat ~•5•2•2)`
Defend against monsters while Mah has her nightmare (progress displayed at the top of the screen). Note: Use Freedom or Anticipate when Mah clenches her hands to avoid being stunned when she screams in agony.`
When the progress is 0%, climb down the summit next to Mah's hand.`
Collect The Measure and place it on the ground near faint wisps to activate them for harvesting (wisps can be found on the centre and edges of the cave. After revealing one, it will be a yellow dot on minimap).`
Convert Mah memories into Mah Energy using the Energy rift. When you gather 250 energy, weave it into a simulacrum (dark to help Zaros, light to hinder Zaros).`
Return to Zaros by exiting the rock face on the wall between two hallways (west of the energy rift). (Chat ~)`
