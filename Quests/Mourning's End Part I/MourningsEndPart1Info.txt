Go to the fractionation still in Rimmington outside of the chemist's house.`

When the pressure enters the green region, rotate the pressure valve clockwise once to let out some pressure. This should stall the pressure indicator.`
Start adding coal. This raises the 'heat' indicator on the right. If it's below the green region, add more coal. If it's above, don't add coal until it gets lower.`
If the heat reading reaches the dark orange portion, you've spoiled your compound and must start again.`
If you run out of coal, your progress will be saved, but you will have to re-set the pressure to add more coal to it.`
