# RS3QuestBuddy
Runescape 3 Quest Buddy is the first of its kind, without time and dedication and the resources available this would not be possible. It contains the knowledge to know what option is the next in the quest ðŸŽ‰ All 261 Quests, 56 Miniquests, and all sub quests. Steps are going to change eventually to better more precise steps eventually moving away from the wiki with new pictures to tell you whats going on, and better clear steps. The steps currently are from the RS Wiki I am wanting to move away from the wiki and aim towards Quality of Life for questing using the RS3 Quest Buddy. The steps are 100% accurate, to what step your on. It is the first project that I have built. If you want to contribute either in code, quest data, information, picture etc. Please Contact Techpure on discord he is really friendly and takes advice like a champ.
