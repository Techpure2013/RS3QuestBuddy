------General Notes-------
Before entering any door, check if there is smoke emitting from the bottom. If there is no smoke, enter the door normally. If there is smoke, right-click Peek through the door, then click the Enter Room button (the animation is irrelevant). Peeking through doors will negate ALL damage taken from the ghost.
You do not heal life points over time; only mystery meat heals you. Mystery meat restores all of your life points once eaten. The Eat Food ability does not consider mystery meat to be food, so you must click to eat it. Deaths are safe (safe for hardcore ironmen as well). The adrenaline from the Persistent Rage can be used to activate regenerate if needed.
Safe rooms save your progress. Dying, exiting the house, or lobbying reverts you to your last saved state with the items and life points that you saved with but not the time.
Temporal chests cannot be opened on the first playthrough when completing the quest itself, so ignore them.
Timers (e.g. 30 minutes remaining) are general guides for the replay challenge. Challenges cannot be completed on the first playthrough, so these should also be ignored. The timer does not pause during dialogue, so players who are trying to do the time challenge should spacebar through the dialogue as quickly as possible. However, players can reset their progress by speaking to Maria outside the mansion. The correct dialogue options are given by the speech bubble icons in the steps below.
You need to have very low latency between your computer and your RuneScape server. Otherwise, the monster will kill you even before the screen shows up, making it impossible to pass this part of the quest.`
