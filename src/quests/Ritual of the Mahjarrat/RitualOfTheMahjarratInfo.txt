Go to the north-eastern Varrock Dig Site winch, climb down and talk to Azzanadra. Ask him about the quest. (Chat 1)`
Setting up the site`
Items needed: Ring of visibility, rope, all items from the previous step, and at least one free inventory space`
Items recommended: Super energy potions, food, and weaponry.`
From the Rellekka Hunter area (fairy ring code: DKS) take the canoe (north-west from fairy ring code: DKS, north of Larry and past the hunter area) to the Mahjarrat Ritual Site Cavern, then squeeze-past the ice block to the east (do not enter the cavern itself). This allows one to skip the Wilderness.`
At Ghorrock, jump over the pillar to the south (it is outside of the building, look for the red line on the dark bottom part) then go through the tunnel.`
Avoid the undead Broavs or the player will get thrown into Zemouregal's dungeon. To escape, search the bed and lift up the tiles to the east of the cell. Enter the tunnel to escape.`
Several items will need to be placed around the ritual site:`
Northern Beacon: Run west from the ice entrance at the north of the plateau. Place the Beacon on the closest tree.
Southern Beacon: Run directly south, and place the second beacon in the tree south-south-west of the ritual stone. If this is done correctly, you should have a message saying the south beacon is opposite the northern beacon.`
Arrav's Heart: Place Arrav's heart in the rocks south of the ritual stone. The site is several paces north of the marker and just a pace or two east. If you cannot place the heart in a pile of rocks, you are at the wrong place.`
Western Beacon: Run up the west side of the plateau until you find a tree just north of a central line. Place the beacon here. Using the tree just south of the central line will not work.`
Eastern Beacon: Run straight east and place the beacon on the tree directly opposite the western tree. You should have a message saying the east beacon is directly opposite the west beacon.`
Go to the north-west corner of the plateau and look for an Overhanging Tree above the Cavern entrance. Use a rope on it to create a rope climb from the beach to the plateau, turning it into a Snow-covered Tree with an attached rope. This will be used for your allies to climb to the ritual. (From now on, you can also use the rope yourself to get between the canoe landing site and the plateau without having to go past the dragons around Ghorrock.)`
Head to Zemouregal's fort which is south-west of the ritual site.`
Kill the Armoured zombie outside of the main entrance and pick up the Code key and Decoder strips.`
Read the code key and open the main entrance by obtaining the code from the key and strips.`
An example of the puzzle. The code reads EIHC, thus the final strip must be placed on the C, revealing that the number is 2.`
Go through the front door and search the crate by the north-eastern weapon rack for the storeroom's Code key.`
Read it and use it to open the storeroom door to the west in the same manner as the front entrance.`
In the northern part of the storeroom, search the crates (2 empty spaces required).`
Read the Heart magic notes.`
Exit the room, head up the western stairs, and try to open the southern door to listen to Zemouregal and Sharathteerk.`
Head back downstairs, then go up the eastern stairs. Use the previously acquired Code key to enter the reliquary.`
Smash the black stone in the southern half of the room.`
Searching for the Stone of Jas`
Exit the fortress and head to the south-eastern part of the ritual site.`
Talk to Movario. (Chat 1•1)`
With the ring of visibility equipped, run west from Movario along southern wall of the site to find a shadow pedestal.`
Go back inside the centre of the Ghorrock Castle courtyard (past the dragons), and climb the western stairs next to the statue of Khazard.`
Go east and climb down the stairs.`
Scale the Damaged Wall next to the door.`
Run past the smashed pedestal, and climb down the smashed rampart on west side of the trapdoor in the courtyard.`
Enter the trapdoor.`
Enter the room to the west and head south.`
Take the Heat globe and return to the shadow pedestal.`
Put the globe on the pedestal.`
If you try to put heat globe on the shadow pedestal and it says "That could be a good idea, but you've got other things to do first.", it means either that the beacons are not aligned properly, you have not placed Arrav's heart in the rocks to the south of the Ritual marker, you haven't placed the rope to the north-west of the tunnel or you have not talked to Movario after having done so.`
If you are completely sure you have done all of these things, talk to Movario to the east of the shadow pedestal, and he will place the heat globe in the pedestal. A few players have removed a beacon from a tree and put in back in the tree—this also has worked. Some report that reading the notes/Dathana's message also fixes this.`
The ritual`
Before doing this part, make sure to prepare for the final fight.`
Enter the newly opened entrance, south of the shadowy pedestal.`
Follow the open passageway and touch the Stone of Jas.`
The battle`
Using an overload or any damage curses or normal damage prayers will cause you not to be able to hit, as it interferes with the Stone of Jas buff.`
Khazard`
After the cutscenes, defeat Khazard.`
It helps to pray against magic and when Bouncer is summoned, lure him to Wahisietel so that he dies.`
Ice titans`
Defeat the Enhanced ice titans.`
Lucien will be casting spells at the player whilst fighting the ice titans. If a smoking black skull is flying towards you, move at least two squares away from your current position. Also, praying melee completely negates damage from the titans' normal attacks. If ice starts encasing the player, they should click rapidly on the ground around them to escape.`
You will only be able to damage the two enhanced ice titans that run at you; your teammates must kill the rest.`
Avoid attacking Lucien, as doing so causes Lucien to hit you with a high damage attack.`
Ice demons`
Defeat the Ice Demons`
Praying against magic helps limit the damage the demons can cause. They will also summon icicles which will fall around the player. When this happens, run out of the icicles to avoid being trapped due to Lucien still casting the skull spell at the player.`
You will only be able to damage the two ice demons that run at you; your teammates must kill the rest.`
Arrav`
Attack the armoured zombies until Arrav is summoned.`
Attack Arrav until he follows you. You may have to attack the zombies before Arrav will follow you.`
Lure him over to where his heart is placed.`
If you have a combat follower out, it is best to dismiss it when Arrav starts following you. Otherwise, it is possible that the combat familiar and Arrav will fight. If this occurs when Arrav gets his heart back, the familiar's attack may distract Arrav from attacking Zemouregal. Instead, Arrav will stand near the rockpile where his heart was hidden and will not move. This is a glitch, and the only way to overcome it is to leave the battle, return, and fight the fourth battle again from its start.`
The broken beacon`
Head to where the southern beacon was.`
Turn on a prayer against ranged or magic attacks and pick up the beacon pieces.`
Click on a piece to assemble all of them and then place the beacon back into the tree.`
Finishing up`
Watch the cutscenes.`
Go to the stalls area of the town (north-west of where the bank would be in Draynor Village) in the destroyed version of Draynor Village.`
Watch the last cutscene.`
Talk to Sir Tiffy. (Chat 1) If Quiet before the Swarm isn't completed (Chat 2).`
