# RS3QuestBuddy

RS3QuestBuddy is a tool built upon the foundations of `Alt1`, utilizing OCR data to guide you through quests in RuneScape 3.

This project is a direct fork of the original, the features included in this version significantly offload data being parsed on the client side.
Thus reducing the load size of the github repo, a CDN is used in place and can be accessed from the public as well.
