Getting started`
Talk to Martin the Master Gardener in the Draynor Market. (Chat 2•✓)`
After 5 minutes have elapsed, talk to him again. (Chat 2)`
Go to Fairy Nuff's grotto, north of the Zanaris bank.`
After a short cutscene, enter the house and pick up the Healing Certificate from the floor in the south-east corner.`
Right-click study on the certificate. (You won't be able to reach the Fairy Resistance HQ if you don't "study" it)`
Use the certificate with the Fairy chef, south of the bank. She will tell you that she's seen similar inscriptions on a sign near the mysterious ruins, that is the cosmic altar, in southern Zanaris.`
Read the rune temple sign, on the ground south of the Cosmic Altar.
Talk to the Fairy Godfather (located in the Throne Room) about the Queen being missing. (Chat 1•1•1)`
Talk to the Co-ordinator just north at the crossroads. (Chat 2)`
Talk to Fairy Fixit near the fairy ring, south-west of the wheat field.`
Equip your Dramen staff, click on the fairy ring and go to each of these codes in this order to reach the hideout: AIR, DLR, DJQ (this may seem like it failed, but continue to the next code anyway), AJS.`
In the Fairy Resistance Hideout, talk to Fairy Nuff and Fairy Very Wise in the northeastern clearing.
Go back (via the fairy ring) and pickpocket the Fairy Godfather for the queen's secateurs (may take several attempts). The Fairy Godfather, Fat Rocco and Slim Louie may need to be looking the other way. (ie. Stand east of him and wait until he looks west and both his guards are looking north).`
Go back to the hideout with the fairy ring ("Fairy Resistance HQ").`
Talk to Fairy Nuff.`
Go back to a fairy ring and use the code CKP.`
Wait 2 minutes and pick a starflower.`
Make sure you have armour required to fight one or multiple Goraks.`
Go back to a fairy ring and use the code DIR.`
Kill Goraks until you get Gorak claws.`
Grind the gorak claw.`
Use the starflower on the vial of water.`
Use the Gorak claw powder on the Magic essence (unf).`
Go back to the Resistance Hideout by equipping your Dramen staff and go to each of these codes in this order to reach the hideout: AIR, DLR, DJQ (right-click fairy ring to "select Destination" for quicker travel), and finally AJS or by selecting the "Fairy Resistance HQ" option 4 times in the travel log. You still need to have Nuff's certificate in your inventory for it to work.`
Talk to Fairy Nuff before giving the queen the magic essence or it wont work.`
At the Resistance Hideout, right-click use the magic essence on the queen, laying on the stretcher near Fairy Nuff.`
